The coordinates of G-quadruplex RNA-bound PRC2 six-subunit complex (PDB: 8FYH) provided a starting model from which all the coordinates were adjusted and rebuilt in the new map using COOT. The model of each PRC2 promoter was subjected to global refinement and minimization in real space using PHENIX. These were then subjected to manual inspection and adjustment in COOT, followed by refinement again in PHENIX. TERRAmut RNA model was generated using a 10-nucleotide single-stranded fragment (UGAGUGUGAG) using AlphaFold3 and then docked into our map for the position we designated as the RNA density.","id":"1"}],"em3d_fitting_list":[{"id":"1","pdb_entry_id":"8FYH","3d_fitting_id":"1"}],"em3d_reconstruction":[{"id":"1","image_processing_id":"1","num_particles":120658,"resolution":3.4,"resolution_method":"FSC 0.143 CUT-OFF","symmetry_type":"POINT"}],"em_ctf_correction":[{"details":"CTFind","em_image_processing_id":"1","id":"1","type":"PHASE FLIPPING AND AMPLITUDE CORRECTION"}],"em_entity_assembly":[{"entity_id_list":["1","2","3","4","5","6","7"],"id":"1","name":"Single-stranded RNA-mediated dimer of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2","parent_id":0,"source":"MULTIPLE SOURCES","type":"COMPLEX"},{"entity_id_list":["2","3","4","5","6","7"],"id":"2","name":"dimer of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2","parent_id":1,"source":"RECOMBINANT","type":"COMPLEX"},{"entity_id_list":["1"],"id":"3","name":"TERRAmut RNA","parent_id":1,"source":"SYNTHETIC","type":"COMPLEX"}],"em_experiment":{"aggregation_state":"PARTICLE","entity_assembly_id":"1","id":"1","reconstruction_method":"SINGLE PARTICLE"},"em_image_recording":[{"avg_electron_dose_per_image":50.0,"details":"Cryo-EM data was collected using a Titan Krios G3i equipped with a Thermo Fisher Falcon 4 direct-electron detector (DED) camera and a Selectris energy filter set with a 10-eV slit width.

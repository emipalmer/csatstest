QUICK START LESSON IDEAS FOR TEACHERS
Using Real PDB Data to Teach Molecular Biology
================================================================================

LESSON 1: 5-Minute Hook (Get Them Interested!)
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Show a colorful 3D protein structure from RCSB PDB
Ask: "Is this art? A building? A living thing?"
Answer: "It's a PROTEIN - made by your cells RIGHT NOW!"

Go to: www.rcsb.org
Search: "insulin" or "hemoglobin"
Click: 3D View → Shows beautiful structure
Action: Let students explore and click around


LESSON 2: Structure Determines Function (1 Class Period)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Analogy: Lock and Key
- Shape of enzyme = lock
- Shape of substrate = key
- When key fits, it works!
- If shape is wrong, it doesn't work

Real Examples:
1. Insulin protein (hormone)
   - Makes energy production work
   - In diabetes, either can't make it or can't use it
   
2. Hemoglobin (oxygen carrier)
   - Normal: Carries oxygen around body
   - Sickle cell mutation: One amino acid different
   - Result: Cells become sickle-shaped, block blood vessels

Activity: Go to RCSB PDB
- Search "insulin" → Look at shape
- Search "hemoglobin" → Find the active site
- Students: "What could break this?", "What would happen if...?"


LESSON 3: How Scientists See Proteins (2-3 Periods)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Problem: Proteins are way too small to see with microscopes!

Solution 1: X-ray Crystallography
- Grow protein crystals
- Shine X-rays on them
- Measure the diffraction pattern
- Computer builds 3D model
- Nobel Prize winners: Bragg family (1915)

Solution 2: Cryo-EM (Electron Microscopy)
- Freeze proteins in super-cold ice
- Shoot electrons at them (more powerful than light)
- Take thousands of images
- Computer combines them into 3D structure
- Nobel Prize 2017: Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank, Richard Henderson

Show Students:
- X-ray diffraction image (looks like dots in a pattern)
- Cryo-EM images (looks like fuzzy dots)
- Final 3D structure (beautiful!)
- Ask: "How would you turn blurry images into a clear 3D model?"


LESSON 4: DNA → RNA → Protein → Function
──────────────────────────────────────────
Show the flow:
DNA Code
  ↓ (Transcription in nucleus)
mRNA Message
  ↓ (Travel to ribosome)
Protein Structure
  ↓ (Fold into 3D)
Biological Function

Real Example - Insulin Gene:
ORIGINAL: ...GAA... (codes for glutamic acid)
MUTATION: ...GUA... (codes for valine) [One base change!]
RESULT: Different amino acid → Different shape → Doesn't work as well

Activity: Show DNA sequence in NCBI
- Find corresponding protein sequence
- Look up that protein structure in PDB
- Discuss: "What does changing one letter do?"


LESSON 5: When Proteins Break (Genetic Diseases)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Disease = Protein doesn't work right

SICKLE CELL ANEMIA
- Hemoglobin protein has mutation
- Changed shape makes proteins stick together
- Red blood cells become sickle-shaped
- Block blood vessels → pain and damage

CYSTIC FIBROSIS
- CFTR protein can't fold correctly
- Misfolded proteins get destroyed
- Can't transport salt and water
- Thick mucus builds up in lungs

HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE
- Huntingtin protein has too many repeats
- Protein misfolds and clumps
- Kills brain cells
- No symptoms until midlife

Activity: Choose a disease
1. Research the mutated protein
2. Find it in PDB database
3. Create a presentation explaining:
   - Normal version vs mutated version
   - Why the mutation causes the disease
   - Possible treatments


LESSON 6: Real-World Applications
──────────────────────────────────
INSULIN
- Extracted from pigs and cows (expensive, limited supply)
- Now: Use genetic engineering
- Insert human insulin gene into bacteria
- Bacteria make human insulin!
- Cost: Down 90%, available to more people

ANTIBODIES as MEDICINE
- Your immune system makes antibodies (Y-shaped proteins)
- Can be designed to attack cancer cells
- Called "monoclonal antibodies"
- Herceptin: Designed to attack breast cancer proteins
- Approved by FDA, saves lives

CRISPR GENE EDITING
- Uses bacterial proteins (Cas9)
- Can edit DNA precisely
- Could fix genetic diseases before symptoms
- Future: Personalized medicine based on your DNA


QUICK ACTIVITY IDEAS
────────────────────
🔬 Measure protein distances
- Open structure in Mol* (mol-star.org)
- Measure distance between two atoms
- Discuss: Why might this distance matter?

🧬 Compare protein sequences
- Use NCBI BLAST
- Compare human insulin to pig, cow, chicken
- Count amino acid differences
- Ask: "Why are some sequences more similar?"

🎨 Draw your observations
- Students sketch what they see in 3D structure
- Label parts (active site, binding pocket, domains)
- Explain relationships in a concept map

🔍 Mutation prediction
- Show a specific amino acid position
- Ask: "What happens if we change this to a different amino acid?"
- Check literature or databases for real mutation effects

📊 Data analysis
- Graph resolution vs discovery date
- Ask: "Is technology improving? How?"
- Project: Future of protein structure determination


ASSESSMENT
──────────
Formative (During learning):
- Observation checklist while exploring PDB
- Student questions (best ones show thinking)
- Peer explanations
- Concept sketches with labels

Summative (After learning):
- Written: Explain how a protein's structure determines its function
- Visual: Create a concept map of protein science
- Problem: Given a mutation, predict its effect
- Project: Analyze a disease-causing protein

# MOLECULAR BIOLOGY CONCEPT MAPPER - Teacher's Guide

## Overview
This framework helps you create concept maps and lesson plans based on real protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).

## What is This Tool?
- **Data Source**: Real 3D protein structures from the RCSB PDB
- **Purpose**: Help students understand molecular biology through authentic scientific data
- **Approach**: Use scientific practices to scaffold learning from atoms to cellular function

## How to Use This Framework

### 1. Understanding Concept Hierarchies
The framework organizes concepts from basic to advanced:
- **Level 1**: Atoms, bonds, amino acids (building blocks)
- **Level 2**: Protein folding, secondary structures
- **Level 3**: Complex protein systems and quaternary structures
- **Level 4**: Biological function in cells
- **Level 5**: How scientists study proteins
- **Level 6**: Real-world applications

### 2. Creating Concept Maps
A concept map shows relationships between ideas:
```
Protein
  ├── Made of: Amino Acids
  │    └── Connected by: Peptide Bonds
  ├── Forms: Secondary Structures
  │    ├── α-helix
  │    └── β-sheet
  ├── Folds into: 3D Structure (Tertiary)
  │    └── Determines: Function
  └── Multiple copies: Quaternary Structure
       └── Example: Hemoglobin (4 subunits)
```

### 3. Using PDB Examples in Class
Each concept has real PDB structure examples. You can:
- Show students actual protein structures via RCSB PDB website
- Have students measure distances between atoms
- Ask students to predict function from structure
- Compare related proteins to see structure variations

### 4. Scientific Practices Integration
Each lesson incorporates the Next Generation Science Standards practices:
- **Asking Questions**: "Why does this protein have this shape?"
- **Developing Models**: Building 3D mental models of structures
- **Analyzing Data**: Using PDB data to support claims
- **Constructing Explanations**: Connecting structure to function
- **Engaging in Arguments**: Debating structure interpretations

### 5. Lesson Structure (5E Model)
Each lesson includes:
1. **Engagement**: Hook with interesting structure
2. **Exploration**: Students investigate the structure
3. **Explanation**: Teacher explains scientific principle
4. **Elaboration**: Apply to new examples
5. **Evaluation**: Assess student understanding

## Assessment Ideas

### Formative Assessment
- **Observation**: Watch students explore PDB structures
- **Concept Sketches**: Have students draw what they observe
- **Exit Tickets**: Quick understanding checks
- **Peer Discussion**: Talk-aloud reasoning

### Summative Assessment
- **Concept Map Creation**: Students build their own concept hierarchies
- **Written Explanation**: Explain protein function from structure
- **Problem Solving**: Predict outcomes of mutations
- **Research Project**: Analyze a protein of interest

## Common Student Misconceptions

1. **"Proteins are static"**
   - Reality: Proteins are dynamic and flexible
   - Solution: Show protein dynamics simulations

2. **"All proteins are enzymes"**
   - Reality: Many structural, regulatory, and transport proteins exist
   - Solution: Classify proteins by function

3. **"Structure is determined by chemistry alone"**
   - Reality: Kinetics, thermodynamics, and cellular environment matter
   - Solution: Discuss protein misfolding and disease

4. **"Amino acids just link in a chain"**
   - Reality: Specific interactions between amino acids drive folding
   - Solution: Show how hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties drive structure

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with small, well-studied proteins
2. **Use Visuals**: Show many different structure representations
3. **Connect to Health**: Link proteins to diseases and treatments
4. **Make it Interactive**: Let students explore PDB structures
5. **Scaffold Complexity**: Build from one subunit to multi-subunit complexes
6. **Real Data**: Always use actual PDB data from research
